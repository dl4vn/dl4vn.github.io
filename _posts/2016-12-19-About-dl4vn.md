## Purposes 
The ultimate purpose is to bring Deep Learning to easier level for everyone who interested can refer enough knowledge, fully understand and implement a runnable project.

### For Editors
  * Practice writing scentific tutorials (it is a good way for practicing writing papers)
  * Enhance knowledge about coding and understand the paper in a deeper level, not just superficial general idea
  * Practice reading papers and giving the reviews/comments about the papers, especially choosing the valuable papers for everyone can get benefit
  * Self promote the editors profile

### For Readers

  * Read the fundamental knowledge about deep learning both theoretical and practical aspects.
  * Read the chosen papers with reviews/comments, the papers in highly recommended in Deep Learning and its application in Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, Speech/Audio Recognition and so on
  * Re-implement the paper’s idea to fully understand the paper with guidance in tutorial
  * Can have the runable code (mostly in Python) and apply directly to own project

## Contents

### General contents
  * Have fundamental knowledge about deep learning and its application
  * Have tutorial on setting up deep learning framework such as Tensorflow, Theano, Keras, Caffe… and other python libraries for scientific research
  * Have news about Deep Learning what is the cutting edge researches and state-of-the-art results in some problems

### Paper Contents:

  * Have group of related papers of Deep Learning problem for example object detection, segmentation, image captioning, Sentiment Analysis, Question Answering...
  * Each paper will have review/comments section which helps reader to get the general idea of the papers (summary), Strength and Weakness. These reviews will be based on Editors's points of view
  * Will have link to Original papers (mostly on Arxiv) and github code from the authors
  
### Tutorial Contents
  * Help you step by step re-implement some chosen important papers in Deep Learning problems with tutorial
  * These codes is mostly implemented in Python 
  * These codes is make sure runnable and can apply directly to reader's own project
  * Mostly writen in Jupyter Notebook format
  
## Website

### The website's address
https://dl4vn.github.io/

### Interface 
Can have format something like Keras, Tensorflow, Theano documentation website.

### Host
All operations will run on github at these address https://github.com/dl4vn/dl4vn.github.io, Dung will have the script to upload the files to github and automatically display on the website.

### Format
With General Contents and Paper Contents, we will use Markdown format.
With Tutorial Contents, we will use Jupyter Notebook format and export to Makrdown format, like this one: https://github.com/dungtn/baby-vqa/blob/master/LSTM_VGG_VQA.ipynb

### Feedback
Will have section for receiving by using Pull request of github:
  * Feedback from reader
  * Suggested important reading papers
  * Need to have tutorial for important papers

## Administrative

### Schedule
  * In the first month/week?, try to complete the General Contents, don't need to write from scratch, can refer to some good links, tutorials already have
  * News can update every day or every week
  * Paper Contents can update whenever editors have completed reading new papers and write comments/reviews
  * Tutorial Contents can update whenver new paper have succesfully implemented in Python and its deep learning framework.
  
### Editors
  * Chief Editors:
    - Dung Thai: Deep Learning in NLP
    - Khoi Nguyen: Deep Learning in CV
    - Kien Huynh: Deep Learning in CV
    - Need somebody work in Deep Learning in General/Theory/Architecture
  * Volunteer Editors:
    - Update news 
    - Write Paper's review/comments
    - Implement important papers
    
### Communication
Base on Github repository of the website, Facebook group
