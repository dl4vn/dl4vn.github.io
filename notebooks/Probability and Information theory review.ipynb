    "# A review of probability and information theory for deep learning\n",
    "*~ based on Chapter 3, Deep Learning by Ian Goodfellow et. al.*\n",
    "\n",
    "This note provides a quick glance to probability and information theory in their relations to deep learning. In particular, their theoretical roles, some common concepts and definitions as well as pointer to some futher readings.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Probability theory** defines a set of rules for deriving uncertain statements and reason in presence of uncertainty.  In the context of machine learning, its laws instruct how the AI systems should reason and behave. Thus, probability theory provides a theoretical framework for designing and reasoning about AI systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Information theory**, on the other hand, allows us to quantify the amount of uncertainty in a probability distribution. **TODO:** ?Measure informative? Generalization?"
